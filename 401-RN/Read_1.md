# Pain vs. Suffering

## Pain:
> *pain happens for a **reason**.*
> *you can't escap it.*

**When Bad happens it will always be followed with good.**

*If you are avoiding pain then your life is **meaningless**.*


## Suffering: 
> *Suffering happens for nothing*.
- *it makes the pain worse then it should be. Freaking out makes thigs even worse.*

**its just a bad habit**

> **STOP**, **BREATHE**, **FEEL**, **LET GO**, **WHAT AM I REACTING TO?**, **WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?** *and do it. by doing that you will getrid of suffering and bad thoughts.*


> *I would never say that it would be easy to getrid of suffering, no, **IT IS HARD**, it's hard because it happens so fast thet we can't control it.* 


# Big O for beginners
> The **worst-case** and we use it to describe the complexity of an algorethm. 

the (N) is the number of functional logical lines in an algorithm



`O(1)` *represents a single **line** algorithm.*

`O(N)` *represents a single **loop** algorithem*

`O(N^2)` *represents a only **two neasted loop** algorithems and we add 1 to the power with every nested loop inside*
```
for t in pets:
    for c in cats:
        print t[c]

```


`O(N^3)` *represents a only **three neasted loop** algorithem*
```
for i in animals:
    for t in pets:
        for c in cats:
            print i[t[c]]

```
`O(2^N)` *represents a **multiplied data algorithm** we find it more often in **recursive** functions.*


**using the Big(O) notation will help us make the best choice to work with.**
