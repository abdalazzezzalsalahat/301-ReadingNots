# Data Visualization 

## Matplotlib 

> *It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.*

###  pyplot

> *It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments.*

## Visualizing statistical relationships

> *Statistical analysis is a process of understanding how variables in a dataset relate to each other and how those relationships depend on other variables. Visualization can be a core component of this process because, when data are visualized properly, the human visual system can see trends and patterns that indicate a relationship.*


## Relating variables with scatter plots 

> *The scatter plot is a mainstay of statistical visualization. It depicts the joint distribution of two variables using a cloud of points, where each point represents an observation in the dataset. This depiction allows the eye to infer a substantial amount of information about whether there is any meaningful relationship between them.*


## Emphasizing continuity with line plotsÂ¶

> *Scatter plots are highly effective, but there is no universally optimal type of visualisation. Instead, the visual representation should be adapted for the specifics of the dataset and to the question you are trying to answer with the plot.*
