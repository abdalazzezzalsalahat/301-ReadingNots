# JupyterLab : 

**Common Formats:**
> *Jupyter supprts many file formats, and if it is not supporting it now it might do in the future.*

* *JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.)*

**Jupyter Notebooks:**
> *Jupyter notebook is written as a markdown file and has a lot of easy shortcuts.*


> > *JupyterLab enables us to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible way.*

# NumPy

[Cheat sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-blog-files/numpy-cheat-sheet.pdf)

`csv => comma-separated values`

`ssv => semicolon separated values`

**NumPy has several different data types, which mostly map to Python data types**

#### *Whith NumPy we work with multidimentional arrays*


##### *NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, we can speed up our workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem.*


**We import Numpy package by typing `import numpy as np`**


**=>** *To read files using NumPy we use `np.genfromtxt(file_name)`.*

### Indexing NumPy Arrays

> `arr [2,3]` to get the 3rd row and 4th column.

### Slicing NumPy Arrays

> `arr[0:3,3]` to get the elemnts from index 0 up to 3.

### NumPy Data Types

> `arr.astype(new_data_type)` to convert data types.

* `int` - integer.
* `float` - numaric with points.
* `string` - charachter.
* `object` - pyhton object.
