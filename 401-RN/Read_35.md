> * special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.*

> We can ise them to initialize, stringfy, iterate objects.



## Iterators

> * They’ll serve as “non-magical” examples and test implementations you can build upon and deepen your understanding with..*

* *The Repeater iterator iterates forever.*


## Generators

> * If you’ve ever implemented a class-based iterator from scratch in Python, you know that this endeavour requires writing quite a bit of boilerplate code..*

**Iterators are so useful in Python: They allow you to write pretty for-in loops and help you make your code more Pythonic and efficient.**

> As a (proud) “lazy” Python developer, I don’t like tedious and repetitive work.
