## How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

**We can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn**

### What is Linear Regression?

> *Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine two things.*

## Types of Linear Regression 

1. *Simple linear regression:* interval or ratio or dichotomous.

2. *Multiple linear regression:* interval or ratio or dichotomous.

3. *Logistic regression:* interval or ratio or dichotomous.

4. *Ordinal regression:*  nominal or dichotomous.

5. *Multinomial regression:* interval or ratio or dichotomous.

6. *Discriminant analysis:* interval or ratio.


## When Do You Need Regression?

> *Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related.*


## Problem Formulation

> *When implementing linear regression of some dependent variable 𝑦 on the set of independent variables.*


## Scikit-learn 

> *A powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.*
