# Testeing & Modules


## TDD
> A test is done to check the behavior and the outbut of our code if it works how it supose to be.

> > Built a reliable code.

#### Testing Cycle: 

1. **Write a code.**
2. **Test it.** 
3. **Fix it.** 
4. **Refactor it *if needed*.**

#### The AAA
1. **Arrange:** organize data(input).
2. **Act:** Test the behavior.
3. **Assert:** check the out put.



## Recursion
> *Is to call a function inside it self to solve problems easly.*

> **We have to think of it as a loop, where we set a condition to break it and it runs for a spisific rounds and returns a result.**


*calling a function inside of its self is called **direct** recursion, and calling a function that calls back the orther function is called **inddirect**.*

> > *It takes longer time to exicute and more ROM space.*

> > **But it give us acleaner code *^_^*.**
