# Graphs 


> *A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.*


## Directed vs Undirected


* **Undirected Graphs:**

> *An Undirected Graph is a graph where each 
edge is undirected or bi-directional.*


* **Directed Graphs (Digraph):**

> *A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a 
graph where every edge is directed.*

* **a Digraph has direction.** 

*Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.*

> **The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.**


___

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

> *There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.*

___


## 1. Complete Graphs

> *A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.*

## 2. Connected

> *A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.*

>>> **A Tree is a form of a connected graph.**

___

## 3. Disconnected

> *A disconnected graph is a graph where some `vertices` may **Not** have `edges`.*


*the disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph.* 

It is complelty possible to have 
standalone `nodes` or `edges` *(also known as 
islands)* in a graph.

___

## Acyclic Graph

> *An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.*

**A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.**
