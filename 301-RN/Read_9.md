# Refactoring

> It's the process of restructuring existing code without changing its behavior.
> it's done to improve the design, structure, and implementation of the code. 

## Code Smells
1. **Bloaters:**  methods and classes that are hard to work with.
2. **Object-Orientation Abusers:** the incomplete or incorrect codes and methods.
3. **Change Preventers:** repeated code everywhere.
4. **Dispensables:** things that are pointless and unneeded.
5. **Couplers:** the excessive attraction behavior of two classes.

## Refactoring Techniques

1. **Composing Methods:** Method that calls out to other methods.

2. **Moving Features between Objects:** Safely move functionality between classes.

3. **Organizing Data:** Replacing primitives with rich class functionality.

4. **Simplifying Conditional Expressions:** Decompose the complicated parts of a conditional into separate methods.

5. **Simplifying Method Calls:** Make method calls simpler and easier to understand.
