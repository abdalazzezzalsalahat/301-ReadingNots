> API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
> 1. API's alows my product or service communicate with other products and services without having to know how theyâ€™re implemented.
> 2. API's are like a contract, if I wanted anything from any service it will give access to and API.
> 3. API's simplify how developers integrate new application components into an existing architectur.

> APIs maintain our security and control.

## API types:
1. **Private**
    > Internal use API's.
2. **Partner**
    > Specified users API's. 
3. **Public**
    > Available to everyone API's.

 > The 6 guiding constraints of a RESTful system:

1. **Client-server architecture:** Composed of clients, servers, and resources.

2. **Statelessness:** No client content is stored on the server.

3. **Cacheability:** Eliminate the need for some client-server interactions using cache.

4. **Layered system:** Additional layers Client-server interactions.

5. **Code on demand (optional):** Extend the functionality of a client.

6. **Uniform interface:** This constraint is core to the design of RESTful APIs and includes 4 facts:
    1. **Resource identification in requests:** Resources are identified in requests and are separate from the client.
    2. **Resource manipulation through representations:** Clients receive files represents resources.
    3. **Self-descriptive messages:** Messages sent to clients have enough information to do the process.
    4. **Hypermedia as the engine of application state:** Discover all actions that are currently available.
