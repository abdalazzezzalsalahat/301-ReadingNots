> **After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.**

> Imagine you have been invited to join one of two groups.

1. Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. 
```
When you watch a video of this group working, 
you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, 
and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. 
When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. 
This team is efficient. 
There is no idle chitchat or long debates. 
The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.
```

2. Team B It’s evenly divided. 
```
It’s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments.
Teammates jump in and out of discussions. 
People interject and complete one another’s thoughts. 
When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. 
At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn’t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.
```

> **If you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B.**
*Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency.* 
**But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid.**

> **‘We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’**

*No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home.*
> **‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’**
