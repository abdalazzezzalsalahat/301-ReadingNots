> **The *<table>* element is used to add tables to a web page.**
> **A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the *<tr>* element.**
> **Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the *<td>* element (or *<th>* if it is a header).**
> **You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.**
> **For long tables you can split the table into a *<thead>,<tbody>*, and *<tfoot>*.**

# Functions
```
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
**Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.**
**Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.**
**An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.**
**In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.**
**Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.**
**JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date.**
**Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.**
**Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).**
