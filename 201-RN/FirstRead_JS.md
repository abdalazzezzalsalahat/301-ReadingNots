> CSS stands for (cascading style sheet) which can control the look and feel 
> of a web page via.

A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration blocks.

**The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.**
**a block contains one or more properties separated by *semicolons*.**
**each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a *colon*.**
**are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by *curly braces*.**

> as we can create elemnts using *HTML*, we can ***assign*** them **properties and unique styles**.

`there are many ways to assign styling to an element`

1. element reference styling
```
a {
 color: #000000;
 text-transform: uppercase;
 text-decoration: none;
 padding: 6px 18px 5px 18px;}
```

2. ID reference styling 
```
#elem {
 color: #000000;
}
```

3. Class reference styling
```
.elem {
 color: #000000;
}
```

4. universal reference styling
```
* {
 color: #000000;
}
```


# coloring
> Use the color property to specify the Foreground Color.
> Use the background-color property to specify the Background Color.
> To specify any color”value” in CSS, there are three ways:
> 1. RGB Values
> 2. HEX Codes
> 3. Color Names

## Every pixel color is a mix of Red, Green, and Blue. When choosing the Foreground & Background colors, make sure there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
**RGBA** indicates _opacity_.

**HSLA** allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an *optional opacity* value.

> coloring in css can be defined in many ways but I like the hexadecimal coloring 


# The ABC of programing

### 1. what is script and how to write it 

**Script is a series of instructions that a computer follow to perform a spicific task**
> Steps of writing a script

1. *state the goal*
    1. #### the big picture of what you want 
    2. #### break it down 
2. *list the tasks*
3. *achieve*

_think as a computer_
once you sat your goal, work on the smaller tasks that need to be achieved
then break these tasks into steps flow in sequence so it can be transleted into script easliy

**form steps to code**
porgram your steps sequence acording to the syntax and vocapulary,
